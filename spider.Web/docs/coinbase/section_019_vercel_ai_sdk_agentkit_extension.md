# Vercel AI SDK AgentKit Extension
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agent-kit/core-concepts/vercel-ai-sdk



## Introduction to Vercel AI SDK

[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) is a library for building AI-powered applications with React and JavaScript/TypeScript. It provides a set of tools and utilities that make it easy to build applications that use AI models, including:

* Streaming responses from AI models
* Managing AI model state
* Building chat interfaces
* Handling tool usage by AI models

[This extension](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit/tree/main/typescript/framework-extensions/vercel-ai-sdk) allows you to easily integrate AgentKit's onchain capabilities with Vercel AI SDK, enabling you to build web applications with AI agents that can interact with blockchain networks and a crypto wallet.

## Why Use Vercel AI SDK with AgentKit

Vercel AI SDK is particularly well-suited for building web applications with AI capabilities. When combined with AgentKit, it enables you to:

* **Build web-based AI agents**: Create web applications with AI agents that can interact onchain
* **Stream AI responses**: Provide a better user experience with streaming responses from AI models
* **Leverage React components**: Use Vercel AI SDK's React components to build chat interfaces
* **Deploy on Vercel**: Easily deploy your application on Vercel's platform

## Installation

For a single command to install all necessary dependencies, run:

```bash lines wrap theme={null}
npm install @coinbase/agentkit-vercel-ai-sdk @coinbase/agentkit ai @ai-sdk/openai
```

To break it down, this package is:

```bash lines wrap theme={null}
npm install @coinbase/agentkit-vercel-ai-sdk
```

This package is used alongside AgentKit and AI SDK, so these will need to be installed as well.

```bash lines wrap theme={null}
npm install @coinbase/agentkit ai
```

Finally, install the model provider you want to use. For example, to use OpenAI, install the `@ai-sdk/openai` package. See [here](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/foundations/providers-and-models#ai-sdk-providers) for a list of supported model providers.

```bash lines wrap theme={null}
npm install @ai-sdk/openai
```

## Basic Usage

The main export of this package is the `getVercelAITools` function. This function takes an AgentKit instance and returns an object containing the tools for the AgentKit agent. This object can then be passed to AI SDK.

Here's a snippet of code that shows how to use the `getVercelAITools` function to get the tools for the AgentKit agent.

###### chatbot.ts

```typescript lines wrap theme={null}
import { getVercelAITools } from "@coinbase/agentkit-vercel-ai-sdk";
import { AgentKit } from "@coinbase/agentkit";
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Get your Coinbase Developer Platform API key from the Portal: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
// Or, check out one of the other supported wallet providers: https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit/tree/main/typescript/agentkit
const agentKit = await AgentKit.from({
  cdpApiKeyName: process.env.CDP_API_KEY_NAME,
  cdpApiKeyPrivateKey: process.env.CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY,
});

const tools = await getVercelAITools(agentKit);

// There are multiple methods to generate text with AI SDK.
// See here for more information: https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"), // Make sure to have OPENAI_API_KEY set in your environment variables
  system: "You are an onchain AI assistant with access to a wallet.",
  prompt: "Print wallet details",
  tools,
  // Allow multi-step tool usage
  // See: https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/foundations/agents#multi-step-tool-usage
  maxSteps: 10,
});

console.log(text);
```

### Using Different Model Providers

Vercel AI SDK supports multiple model providers. Here's how to use different providers:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript OpenAI theme={null}
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

  const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  system: "You are an onchain AI assistant with access to a wallet.",
  prompt: "Print wallet details",
  tools,
  maxSteps: 10,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript Anthropic theme={null}
  import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

  const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
  system: "You are an onchain AI assistant with access to a wallet.",
  prompt: "Print wallet details",
  tools,
  maxSteps: 10,
  });
  ```

  ```typescript Mistral theme={null}
  import { mistral } from "@ai-sdk/mistral";

  const { text } = await generateText({
  model: mistral("mistral-large-latest"),
  system: "You are an onchain AI assistant with access to a wallet.",
  prompt: "Print wallet details",
  tools,
  maxSteps: 10,
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tool Execution Errors

If you encounter errors during tool execution, check the following:

* Ensure your CDP API keys are correctly set in environment variables
* Verify that the network you're using is supported by the action provider
* Check that you have sufficient funds for any transactions

#### Model Provider Issues

If you're having issues with the model provider:

* Ensure you have the correct API key set for your model provider
* Check that you're using a model that supports tool usage
* Verify that you've installed the correct model provider package

### Debugging Tips

* Set `debug: true` in the options for `getVercelAITools` to see more detailed logs
* Use the `maxSteps` parameter to limit the number of tool calls the model can make
* Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see the requests being made
