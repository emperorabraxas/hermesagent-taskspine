# Agentic Wallet
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentic-wallet/welcome



Give your AI agent a wallet. Pay for APIs, send money, and trade tokens safely, with built-in spending limits.

## What is Agentic Wallet?

Agentic Wallet gives any AI agent a standalone wallet to hold and spend stablecoins, or trade for other tokens on Base.

Built on Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) infrastructure, agents can authenticate via email OTP, hold USDC, and send, trade, or pay for services without ever accessing private keys.

### Security

* **Key isolation**: Private keys stay in Coinbase infrastructure
* **Spending guardrails**: Enforce limits before any transaction
* **KYT screening**: Block high-risk interactions automatically
* **Built-in OFAC compliance**: All transfers are automatically screened against OFAC sanctions lists and blocked before submission onchain, helping agents operate within regulatory bounds on Coinbase's trusted, compliant crypto infrastructure

## Components

### awal CLI

Command-line tool for wallet operations. Use it directly for testing, or let agents invoke it via skills.

```bash theme={null}
npx awal status      # Check auth status
npx awal send 1 vitalik.eth   # Send USDC
npx awal trade 5 usdc eth     # Swap tokens
```

### Agent Skills

Instead of manually wiring wallet operations into your agent, install skills and let the agent handle it.

```bash theme={null}
npx skills add coinbase/agentic-wallet-skills
```

Skills include: authenticate, fund, send, trade, search-for-service, pay-for-service, monetize-service.

### x402 Integration

Protocol for machine-to-machine payments. Agents can both consume and provide paid APIs with [x402](/x402/core-concepts/how-it-works), enabling agent-to-agent commerce.
