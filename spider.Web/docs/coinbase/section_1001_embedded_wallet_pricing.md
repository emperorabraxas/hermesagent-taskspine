# Embedded Wallet Pricing
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/embedded-wallets/pricing



## Overview

CDP Embedded Wallets operate on a simple pay-as-you-go pricing model, with no tiers or minimums. Start building immediately with our generous free tier of 5,000 wallet operations per month. As you grow, you only pay for what you use.

Developers are charged for the number of `Wallet operations` that are consumed. Wallet operations include wallet creation, transaction signing, transaction broadcast, and policy evaluations.

We only charge for write operations; all read operations are completely free.

To help you estimate costs, the following table outlines the number of Wallet operations associated with various common actions.

| Embedded Wallet action                | Number of Wallet operations |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Create EVM account                    | 1                           |
| Create EVM smart account              | 1                           |
| Sign a message / payload              | 1                           |
| Send a transaction (Sign + Broadcast) | 2                           |
| Create EIP-7702 delegation            | 2                           |

Each wallet operation costs \$0.005.
