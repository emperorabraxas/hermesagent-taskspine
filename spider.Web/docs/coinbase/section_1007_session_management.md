## Overview

Understanding how user sessions work with Embedded Wallets is crucial for building secure applications with proper authentication flows. Sessions are managed through a dual-token system designed to balance security and user experience.

## Session duration

User sessions are managed through a dual-token system:

* **Maximum session length**: 7 days
* **Access token expiry**: 15 minutes
* **Refresh token expiry**: 7 days

## How session tokens work

When a user successfully authenticates, they receive:

1. **Access token**: Short-lived (15 minutes) token used for API requests
2. **Refresh token**: Long-lived (7 days) token used to obtain new access tokens

The refresh token automatically generates new access tokens as needed, providing seamless authentication for up to 7 days. After 7 days, users must re-authenticate.

## Session lifecycle

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Initial authentication">
    1. User completes email/SMS OTP verification or other authentication method
    2. System issues both access and refresh tokens
    3. User gains immediate access to their wallet
    4. Session remains active for up to 7 days with automatic token refresh
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic token refresh">
    * Access tokens are automatically refreshed using the refresh token
    * Applications continue working without interruption
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session expiration">
    * After 7 days, the refresh token expires
    * User must complete authentication again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation considerations

* Monitor authentication state using `onAuthStateChange()` to handle session expiration
* Implement graceful fallback when tokens expire
* Consider showing session timeout warnings to users approaching the 7-day limit
* Test your application's behavior when refresh tokens expire

## Sign out functionality

Always provide a clear way for users to sign out using the `signOut()` method from `@coinbase/cdp-core` or the `AuthButton` component which handles sign out automatically.

For React applications, you can also use the `useSignOut` hook:

```tsx theme={null}
import { useSignOut } from '@coinbase/cdp-hooks';

function SignOutButton() {
  const { signOut } = useSignOut();
  return <button onClick={signOut}>Sign Out</button>;
}
```

## Custom authentication sessions

If you're using [custom authentication](/embedded-wallets/custom-authentication) with your own identity provider, session management works differently:

* **Token lifecycle**: Managed by your identity provider (Auth0, Firebase, etc.)
* **No CDP token refresh**: CDP always requests a fresh JWT via the `getJwt` callback
* **Session duration**: Controlled by your IDP's configuration
* **Sign out**: Only need to sign out from your IDP

For more details on custom authentication, see the [Custom Authentication guide](/embedded-wallets/custom-authentication).
