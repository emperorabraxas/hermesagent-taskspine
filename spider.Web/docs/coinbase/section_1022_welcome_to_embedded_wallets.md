## Overview

With Embedded Wallets, your users can access the full power of blockchains through familiar authentication methods like email and social logins (no seed phrases, browser extensions, or pop-ups required).

Built on Coinbase's trusted infrastructure, they enable users to interact with blockchain applications without the complexity of traditional wallet management.

## How it works

Embedded Wallets are designed to be invisible to end-users while providing full onchain functionality:

1. **User authentication**: Users sign in with familiar methods like email OTP
2. **Invisible wallet creation**: A wallet is instantly created without seed phrases or pop-ups

## Security and compliance

Embedded Wallets leverage CDP's advanced security infrastructure to provide true self-custody with enterprise-grade protection:

* **Advanced security architecture**: All cryptographic operations occur within secure, isolated environments that even Coinbase cannot access
* **Temporary Wallet Secrets**: Device-specific cryptographic keys are generated and stored locally on users' devices, never exposed to Coinbase
* **True self-custody**: Unlike traditional MPC solutions, our approach ensures faster operations while maintaining user control
* **Multi-device support**: Users can securely access their wallet from up to 5 different devices
* **Built-in OFAC compliance**: All transfers are automatically screened against OFAC sanctions lists. Transfers to sanctioned addresses are blocked before submission onchain, helping you meet regulatory requirements without additional integration work

This architecture combines the convenience of embedded wallets with the security guarantees of self-custodial solutions, ensuring your users maintain full control of their assets. Learn more in [Security & Export](/embedded-wallets/security-export).

## Webhooks

Native webhook support for Embedded Wallets is coming soon. In the meantime, you can use [Onchain Data Webhooks](/data/webhooks/quickstart) to track transfer activity on your users' wallet addresses.

See the [CDP Webhooks guide](/get-started/webhooks) for a full overview of webhook options.
