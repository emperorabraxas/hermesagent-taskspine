These release notes list changes to Coinbase Exchange.

## 2026-Feb-02

**Address Book Support for All EVM Networks**

We have expanded the Address Book to support EVM-wide address entries for all assets. This allows customers to store addresses once across all EVM networks.
To support this, we have updated the currencies and address book endpoints.

A new value of `_ALL_EVM_NETWORKS_` has been added to the `network` field in the address book endpoints. This value is only valid when the currency is `_ALL_ASSETS_`.

Example request `POST https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/address-book`.

```
{
  "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  "currency": "_ALL_ASSETS_",
  "network": "_ALL_EVM_NETWORKS_"
}
```

For more details, refer to the [Address Book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/address-book/add-addresses) REST endpoint.

In addition, we have added a new field under the `supported_networks` object in the currencies endpoints to indicate if the network is an EVM-compatible blockchain.

```
"is_evm_network": true
```

For more details, refer to the [Currencies](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/currencies/get-all-known-currencies) REST endpoint.

## 2026-JAN-15

**Counterparty Address API Access**

Clients can now programmatically retrieve stored counterparty addresses from their Address Book. This feature enables direct access to saved address data via the API.

For implementation details, refer to the [Get Counterparty Address Book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/address-book/get-counterparty-address-book) REST endpoint.

## 2025-DEC-11

Coinbase has released Counterparty Transfers [API](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/transfers/withdraw-to-counterparty) access for all customers. This will allow customers to transfer crypto to and from other Coinbase customers without incurring on chain fees.
For more details, navigate to the [Withdraw to counterparty Id](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/transfers/withdraw-to-counterparty) REST endpoint.

## 2025-OCT-31

Coinbase implemented the following changes to our FIX DC channel on October 30, 2025:

**FIX Drop Copy Session**:

* Execution Reports (ER) will be delivered for `cancelled` and `Stop-Limit activation` orders.
* Note: Execution Reports for  `new` or `changed` orders was implemented on October 1, 2025

Coinbase implemented the following changes to our FIX MD channel on October 9, 2025:

**FIX Market Data**

* A `TradeID` tag has been added to completed order messages, i.e messages with MDEntryType=Trade (269=2)
* `<field number='1003' name='TradeID' type='STRING'/>`

## 2025-OCT-20

Coinbase implemented the following changes to our TLS requirements October 20, 2025:

Effective Monday, Oct. 20th 2025, Coinbase Exchange implemented a change to our exchange.coinbase.com domain to only allow system access requests that utilize TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.2 or higher.
This means that any client applications, trading bots, or other automated systems that currently rely on older versions of TLS (such as TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1) will no longer be able to establish a secure connection with the Coinbase Exchange domain.

## 2025-OCT-1

Coinbase is implementing the following changes to our FIX channels on October 2, 2025

**FIX Drop Copy Session**

* Execution Reports (ER) will be delivered for ‘new’ or ‘changed’orders. Note: ER’s for cancelled orders coming soon

**FIX OE Session**

* Execution Reports (ER) for orders placed in previous sessions will now be delivered to currently connected sessions, if applicable.

## 2025-SEP-3

Enabling RFQs in terms of CashOrderQty (152)

* Adding CashOrderQty (152) to Quote\_Request (R) messages
* Adding BidCashOrderQty (8234) and OfferCashOrderQty (8235) tags to Quote (S) messages
* Adding LeavesFunds (8152) and CashOrderQty (152) to Execution Reports (8)

We will allow RFQ takers to submit orders using a quantity specified in terms of the quote\_currency.   The quote\_currency refers to the USD quantity or latter currency in the product pair (e.g. for BTC-USD, quote\_currency = USD.  For BTC-SOL, quote\_currency = SOL).\
As a result, LPs must respond in terms of quote\_currency, as indicated by FIX tag CashOrderQty (152) on the Quote\_Request (R) message.

* LPs must respond with the full BidCashOrderQty (8234) | BidPx (132) and OfferCashOrderQty (8235) | OfferPx (133) on their corresponding Quote (S) message.
* Execution Reports (8) for corresponding orders will reflect the CashOrderQty (152) and the OrderQty (38), which is calculated as such:
  * OrderQty (38) = (CashOrderQty / (BidPx or OfferPx))
* Execution Reports (8) will also contain LeavesFunds (8152) field to indicate remaining CashOrderQty (152) that is unfilled.

Sample Execution Report:

```
8=FIXT.1.1|9=440|35=8|49=Coinbase|56=TARGET_COMP_ID|34=15|50=TEST|52=20250408-03:34:32.789012|369=8|6=70000|
11=CLIENT_ORDER_ID|14=0.01428|17=EXEC_ID|37=ORDER_ID|39=2|55=BTC-USD|54=2|40=2|32=0.01428|31=70000|44=70000|38=0.01428|
60=20250408-03:34:32.784254|152=999.60015994|150=F|8152=0|59=4|126=20250408-03:34:39.467|136=1|137=0.249900039985|
138=USD|139=4|891=0|10=204
```

## 2025-AUG-12

We've added a new `network` field to the POST, GET and PUT /address-book endpoints. You will be able to designate a network when creating or modifying whitelisted addresses in the address book. The response body will include the `network` field indicating the network of the address.

## 2025-JUN-3

The FIX 4.2 Order Entry Gateway has been deprecated on <b>June 3rd, 2025</b>. For FIX based order entry, <b>leverage the newer, more performant</b> [FIX 5 Order Entry Gateway](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5).

### 2025-MAY-27

We removed support for the Iceberg Order Type. This applies to both FIX4.2 and FIX5.
We will continue to monitor client needs and hope to reintroduce an enhanced version of this order type with broader support in the future.

### 2025-MAY-13

  * URI:
    * **Prod** tcp+ssl://fix-dc.exchange.coinbase.com
    * **Sandbox** tcp+ssl://fix-dc.sandbox.exchange.coinbase.com
  * Port: 6122
* New tags on Execution Reports on DC:
  * ClOrdID `<11>`: (String), An identifier specified by the sender to uniquely identify other messages correlating to this request.
  * OrdStats `<39>`: (Char), Identifies current status of order.
  * OrdQty `<38>`: (Qty), Quantity ordered.
  * OrdType `<40>`: (Char), Order type.
  * LeavesQty `<151>`: (Qty), Quantity open for further execution.
  * CashOrderQty `<152>`: (Qty), Specifies the approximate order quantity desired in total monetary units vs. as a number of shares.

<Note>
  Previously, `DropCopyFlag` was enabled by default in FIX 4.2. (It was always disabled in [FIX 5.0](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5#logon-35a)).
</Note>

### 2023-OCT-24

Added `destination_tag_regex` field to the `supported_networks` of the `currencies` object in [Status message](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#status-channel)

  `POST https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/address-book`

### 2023-AUG-28

Exchange began enforcing the following validation logic:

* **REST & FIX**: Extra leading zeros on quantities and prices are not accepted. They must be in standard form.
* **FIX only**: When sending market orders, only `CashOrderQty` or `OrderQty` can be included on the order, not both.
* **REST only**: When sending market orders, only `size` or `funds` can be included on the order, not both.

### 2023-AUG-14

Added the following RFQ features to production:

#### FIX

* Quote (S): The response was reduced to 250ms (from 1000ms).
* MiscFeeAmt (137): Fees are returned on MiscFeeAmt (137) per product.
  * Fees published on tag `137` match what is available on the REST endpoint.

### 2023-AUG-03

Added the ability to [download FIX specifications](/exchange/fix-api/dictionary-downloads).

### 2023-AUG-01

The following WebSocket feeds now enforce authentication (in addition to the [User channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#user-channel)):

* [Full channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#full-channel)
* [Level2 channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#level2-channel)
* [Level3 channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#level3-channel)

See [WebSocket Authentication](/exchange/websocket-feed/authentication) for instructions.

<Warning>
  Coinbase recommends that you authenticate *all* WebSocket channels, but only those noted above are enforced.
</Warning>

<Info>
  To continue receiving Level 2 data without authentication, you can use the [Level2 Batch Channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#level2-batch-channel), which delivers Level 2 data in batches every 50 milliseconds.
</Info>

### 2023-JUL-21

Added the Exchange FIX 5.0 SP2 specification for Order Entry (sandbox only):

* Exchange FIX 5.0 SP2 [Order Entry (Sandbox Only)](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5)

* [Add new crypto address to address book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/address-book/add-addresses)

  `POST https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/address-book`

* [Delete an address from address book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/address-book/delete-address)

  `DELETE https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/address-book/{address_book_id}`

### 2023-JUN-13

Added documentation on [Systems & Operations](/exchange/introduction/systems-operations)

### 2023-JUN-06

Updated the Exchange FIX 4.2 specification

| 16  | [EndSeqNo](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.2/tagnum_16.html)  | Sequence number of last message in range to be resent  |

### 2023-APR-24

We added USD ⟨⟩ USDC unification which lets Coinbase Exchange users update their settlement preference to be either the stable coin counterpart for a fiat currency, or the fiat currency itself.

* [Update settlement preference](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/users/update-settlement-preference)

  `POST https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/users/{user_id}/settlement-preferences`

### 2023-APR-19

Added functionality for users to stake-wrap ETH to CBETH via Web & API:

* [Create a new stake-wrap](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/create-new-stake-wrap)

  `POST https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/wrapped-assets/stake-wrap`

* [Get all stake-wraps](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-all-stake-wraps)

  `GET https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/wrapped-assets/stake-wrap`

* [Get a single stake-wrap](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-all-wrapped-assets)

  `GET https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/wrapped-assets/stake-wrap/{stake_wrap_id}`

Learn more at [Coinbase Exchange CBETH Stake Wrap Instructions](https://coinbase.bynder.com/m/5d3cff1b03f8aeb0/original/exchange-CBETH-Stake-Wrap-Instructions.pdf).

### 2023-MAR-29

We added a new [Level3 WebSocket channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#level3-channel) which is a compact, low bandwidth, and easier to parse version of the Full channel.

### 2023-MAR-15

Added new `apy` field to [Get Wrapped Asset Details](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-wrapped-asset-details).

Implied APY is the current annualized percentage yield earned as the net rewards by the staked ETH underlying cbETH. This estimate is based on the past 7 days of staking performance and is updated daily. For more details, refer to the "rate calculation" section of the [cbETH whitepaper](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper).

### 2023-MAR-02

We added a `time` property that denotes the last time our system processed an update.

**REST API**

[Get product book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/products/get-product-book) now returns `time` as a property when passing in "level=L1" / "level=L2" / "level=L3" on the `/products/{product_id}/book/` endpoint.

**Websocket API**

[Level2 Channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#level2-channel) now includes the `time` property on the level2 snapshot message.

### 2023-MAR-01

We updated the Market Data feed: `client-oid` was removed from the **unauthenticated** [Full Channel Received message](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#received).

The `client-oid` field will still be available in the authenticated Full Channel, and also the [User Channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#user-channel) (which also requires authentication). You can only see your own `client-oid`.

### 2023-FEB-23

#### FIX Execution Report ExecID

We released a change to how we publish the FIX tag, `ExecID (Tag=17)`. `ExecID` will now be consistent across sessions for the same underlying Execution Report. This should allow users the **ability to join Execution Reports** between their trading session and their drop-copy session for the same profile ID.

#### FIX Market Data Gateway

We released [FIX Market Data gateway](/exchange/fix-api/market-data) (**beta**) to production. It is based on the [FIX 5.0 SP2 specification](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/5.0.sp2/index.html).

<Info>
  * Sandbox URL: `tcp+ssl//fix-md.sandbox.exchange.coinbase.com:6121`
  * Production URL: `tcp+ssl//fix-md.exchange.coinbase.com:6121`
</Info>

This new offering provides an L3 feed only with direct, low-latency, deterministic access. Users must connect with the same authentication as our existing FIX order-entry system.

* [Header](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#header)
* [Logon (35=A)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#logon-35a)
* [Market Data Request (35=V)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#market-data-request-35v)
* [Market Data Request Reject (35=Y)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#market-data-request-reject-35y)
* [Security Status (35=f)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#security-status-35f)
* [Market Data Incremental Refresh (35=X)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#market-data-incremental-refresh-35x)
* [Market Data Snapshot Full Refresh (35=W)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#market-data-snapshot-full-refresh-35w)
* [Security List Request (35=x)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#security-list-request-35x)
* [Security List (35=y)](/exchange/fix-api/market-data#security-list-35y)

### 2023-JAN-30

#### Expire Time Tag

Added FIX message tag `ExpireTime` to Quote Request (R) and Quote Status Report (AI).

#### High Bid Limit Percentage

Added new `high_bid_limit_percentage` field to our products endpoint.

As described in our [Trading Rules](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/trading_rules), the **High Bid Limit** (HBL) order control limits how high a Buy Limit Order can be filled based on the last sale price or the current best bid price.

Currently, the High Bid Limit is calculated as follows:

* **Last execution price + `high_bid_limit_percentage`** if the current best bid price is \< 95% of the last execution.
* **Current best bid price + `high_bid_limit_percentage`** otherwise.

HBL is only enforced for specific trading pairs. You can see which trading pairs have an HBL set by looking at the `high_bid_limit_percentage` field of our [/products](https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products) endpoint.

For example, the following value represents a 3% high bid limit.

```
{
  "high_bid_limit_percentage":"0.03000000"
}
```

### 2023-JAN-26

We made a breaking change to **[Get all wrapped assets](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-all-wrapped-assets)**. Specifically, `GET /wrapped-assets/` now returns a list of json objects instead of a list of strings.

### 2023-JAN-06

Added new [Get Wrapped Asset Details](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-wrapped-asset-details) endpoint: `/wrapped-assets/{wrapped_asset_id}/`

Get Wrapped Asset Details returns the following properties:

* `circulating_supply`: Customer held wrapped assets, not pre-minted or held in abeyance.
* `total_supply`: Wrapped assets that have been minted and exist on-chain.
* `conversion_rate`: Underlying staked units that can be exchanged for 1 wrapped asset.

For example:

```
{
  "wrapped_assets":[
    {
      "id":"CBETH",
      "circulating_supply":"314666.9334401934801646",
      "total_supply":"1067354.0841178434801646",
      "conversion_rate":"1.0241755005866786"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can test for cbETH in the sandbox at `https://api-public.sandbox.exchange.coinbase.com/wrapped-assets/CBETH/`

### 2022-DEC-09

Request For Quote on Coinbase Exchange is live in production. RFQ allows liquidity providers to respond and interact with real-time RFQ requests.

**New FIX Messages:**

* RFQ Request (AH)
* Quote Request (R)
* Quote (S)
* Quote Status Report (AI)

**New WebSocket Channel:** [RFQ Matches Channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#rfq-matches-channel).

**Updated REST API:**

* Order and fill information for RFQ can be queried with new `market_type` query parameter.
* New report type option, `rfq-fills`, can be used to generate reports for RFQ fills.

### 2022-NOV-22

We released [Coinbase Direct Market Data](/exchange/websocket-feed/overview), a WebSocket endpoint with direct access to Coinbase Exchange servers. [Authentication](/exchange/websocket-feed/authentication) is required. You can subscribe to both endpoints, but if `ws-direct` becomes your primary connection, we recommend using the existing `ws-feed` as a failover connection.

**Coinbase Direct Market Data endpoint:** `wss://ws-direct.exchange.coinbase.com`

### 2022-OCT-26

Updated **[Get all fills](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/orders/get-all-fills)** with new response property, `market_type`, in preparation for the upcoming Request For Quote (RFQ) feature.

### 2022-OCT-17

Added two new fields to the [Ticker Channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#ticker-channel): `best_bid_size` and `best_ask_size`.

### 2022-OCT-04

Modify Order Request (G) is live in production. See [2022-JUN-27](#2022-jun-27) for release details.

### 2022-SEP-22

FIX Logon (A) messages now require that MsgSeqNum (34) be equal to `1`. Any other value is rejected.

### 2022-SEP-19

Added **[Balance Statement Reports](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/reports/get-all-reports)** for historical and current crypto/fiat balances, with the Exchange REST API and in the Exchange UI at [`exchange.coinbase.com/profile/statements`](https://exchange.coinbase.com/profile/statements).

* [Create Balance Statement Report](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/reports/create-report)
* [Get Balance Statement Reports](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/reports/get-report)

The Balance Report API:

* Leverages the existing `/reports` endpoint.
* Adds a new report type of `balance`.
* Adds a `balance` object to the request with `datetime` (and `group_by_portfolio_id` for the UI only).
* Keeps the same response schema (with the possibility that `"type"="balance"`).

*Example of Balance Report API Request*

```json lines wrap theme={null}
// Create balance statement for the portfolio tied to the API key
{
  "balance": {
    "datetime": "2022-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "email": "user1@example.com",
  "format": "csv",
  "type": "balance"
}
```

### 2022-AUG-24

Added a new Wrapped Asset API, comprised of two endpoints:

* [Get all wrapped assets](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-wrapped-asset-details): Returns a list of all Coinbase supported wrapped asset IDs.

  ```
  /wrapped-assets
  ```

* [Get conversion rate of wrapped asset](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/wrapped-assets/get-wrapped-asset-conversion-rate): Returns the conversion rate of a wrapped asset to its corresponding staked asset.

  ```
  /wrapped-assets/{wrapped_asset_id}/conversion-rate
  ```

### 2022-AUG-16

Added a `reason` field to the WebSocket Full Channel [Change message](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#change):

* `"reason":"STP"` for Self-Trade Prevention message
* `"reason":"modify_order"` for Modify Order Request (See [2022-JUN-27](#2022-jun-27) entry for more.)

```json lines wrap theme={null}
{
  "type": "change",
  "reason": "STP",

  "old_size": "12.234412",
  "new_size": "5.23512",
  "price": "400.23"
}
```

### 2022-JUL-27

We added support for multiple blockchain networks. Users can now withdraw USDC on Solana, and ETH, USDC, and MATIC on Polygon.

A new `network` field was added for select endpoints and in the UI. Affected API endpoints are:

* `/withdrawals/crypto` accepts an optional network parameter as part of its `POST` request parameters.

  This parameter designates which network the currency will be sent on. For example, if the user withdraws USDC on Solana or Ethereum, the withdrawal address is validated against the network, the appropriate fee is calculated based on the network, and the currency is sent over the network. If no network is specified in the `POST` request, the default network (Ethereum) is used.

* `/address-book` validates new addresses against all supported networks for the currency.

* `/address-validation` accepts an optional `network` parameter in the `address_info` object or `source` parameter in the body as part of its `POST` request parameters.

  The address validator uses the `network` parameter to verify that the address is valid for the designated network. If no `network` is specified in the `POST` request, the default network is used.

  The `source` parameter currently only accepts the value `address_book`. When `source` has the value `address_book`, the address is validated against all supported networks for the currency.

```

### 2022-JUL-25

We increased the order size for two FIX batched messages from 10 to 15:

* New Order Batch (U6)
* Order Cancel Batch Request (U4)

### 2022-JUN-30

The following API parameters were removed per the lifting of [maximum and minimum order size limits](#2022-jun-02):

| API Parameter      | Description                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| base\_max\_size    | Base order size max (limit orders)   |
| base\_min\_size    | Base order size min (limit orders)   |
| max\_market\_funds | Quote order size max (market orders) |

Affected features are:

* REST API: [Get all known trading pairs](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/products/get-all-known-trading-pairs)
* REST API: [Create a new order](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/orders/create-new-order)
* Websocket API [Status Channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#status-channel)

### 2022-JUN-27

Modify Order Request (G) is now **available for testing** in the [public sandbox](/exchange/introduction/sandbox). It will go to production in a few weeks.

Modify Order Request is an implementation of the [Order Replace Request](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.2/msgtype_g_71.html) outlined in the FIX 4.2 protocol. You can send a single request to modify the price or size of an existing order using the FIX API.

[WebSocket Full channel "Change"](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#change) messages (and by extension the [User channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#user-channel)) are also affected. Three fields are being added (`new_price`, `old_price`, `reason`).

<Info>
  Modify Order Requests that amend size down will retain queue priority in the Exchange order book.
</Info>

**FIX API**

**Websocket Full Channel Change Message**

Example of a change message from a Modify Order Request:

<Warning>
  The fields `new_price`, `old_price`, and `reason` are being added. (The `reason` field was added on [2022-AUG-16](#2022-aug-16).
</Warning>

```json lines wrap theme={null}

  "old_price": "7",
  "new_price": "6"
}
```

### 2022-JUN-02

Lifted maximum and minimum order size limits. With this change:

* Market orders are no longer subject to max or min size checks unless market funds are specified.
* Limit orders are now subject to **notional minimum size checks only**. We repurposed the existing API parameter, `min_market_funds`, to represent this value.

Price Protection Points serve as a dynamic and real-time protection against slippage for large-sized orders.

The following API parameters have been deprecated (and will be removed June 30):

| API Parameter      | Description                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| base\_max\_size    | Base order size max (limit orders)   |
| base\_min\_size    | Base order size min (limit orders)   |
| max\_market\_funds | Quote order size max (market orders) |

Affected APIs are [Get all known trading pairs](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/products/get-all-known-trading-pairs) and [Create a new order](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/orders/create-new-order).

### 2022-MAY-25

Changes were made to Coinbase Pro:

* We disabled the Coinbase Pro API, [Deposit from Coinbase account](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/transfers/deposit-from-coinbase-account), which lets you deposit funds from a Coinbase retail account into Coinbase Pro. The endpoint `/deposits/coinbase-account` now returns a `403` when called from a Coinbase Pro account.

  All other payment methods into Coinbase Pro remain the same and Coinbase Exchange is not affected.

* Creating a new API Key on Coinbase Pro with the Transfer permission has new requirements (the use of old API keys will remain the same):

  * You must enable non-SMS 2FA.
  * You must allowlist all receive addresses for your transfers.

  Creating new API Keys on Coinbase Exchange is not affected by this change.

### 2022-MAY-05

* Added cancel reason to the FIX and websocket feeds.

- For FIX, we enhanced the Execution Report to include the cancel reason using the [Text field](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.2/tagNum_58.html).
- For the websocket feed, we added a new `cancel_reason` field for authenticated messages by the user, accessible in the [Full](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#full-channel) and [User](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#user-channel) channels.

Supported cancel reasons are:

```
101:Time In Force
102:Self Trade Prevention
103:Admin
104:Price Bound Order Protection
105:Insufficient Funds"
106:Insufficient Liquidity
107:Broker
```

### 2022-MAY-02

We enabled new TLS/SSL features on the FIX servers for Exchange/Pro to increase security and performance. This includes limiting the supported ciphers and a new SSL certificate. Please check that your FIX SSL client:

* Can support the new ciphers listed below.
* Is not validating a specific SSL server certificate. If it is, you must update to the new certificate.

The new infrastructure will support only **TLSv1.2** with the following Supported Server Ciphers:

| Recommend | Length   | Cipher Suite                | Elliptic Curve      |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Preferred | 128 bits | ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | Curve P-256 DHE 256 |
| Accepted  | 128 bits | ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256     | Curve P-256 DHE 256 |

### 2022-APR-14

* Updated the maximum number of portfolios (or profiles) to 25.

### 2022-MAR-21

* Updated the maximum number of portfolios (or profiles) to 15.

### 2022-MAR-17

* Added FIX message tags: `cumQty`, `leaveQty`, `AvgPx`

### 2022-FEB-22

* REST API will enforce case sensitivity for all URLs.
  * Example: [https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/Ticker](https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/Ticker) should be [https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/ticker](https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/ticker). Note the lowercase `t` in `ticker`.
  * This does not apply to URL parameters, just the URL itself: `https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/orders?product_id=BTC-USD&sortedBy=created_at&sorting=desc&limit=100` is valid as the URL is lowercase. Query parameters such as `product_id` can have values with capitals. However `https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/Orders?product_id=BTC-USD&sortedBy=created_at&sorting=desc&limit=100` would be invalid as the `O` in `/Orders` is not the same URL as specified in its [docs](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/orders/get-all-orders).

### 2022-JAN-31

* Web Socket API users are notified when the client is actively disconnected for having a full buffer, or for being too slow to consume or read messages.

### 2022-JAN-25

* `GET` and `POST` responses for the `/orders` endpoint will return client order id as `client_oid` if exists.

### 2021-OCT-25

* FIX API will now enforce CheckSum validations for incoming FIX messages.

### 2021-SEP-21

* All reports can be generated in parallel. Clients are no longer restricted to only have 3 reports being created at a time. Now clients can have up to 3 accounts reports and 3 fills reports *per* product generating at a time.

### 2021-SEP-09

* Return the full aggregated order book for Level 2 queries under the `GET /products/<product-id>/book` endpoint.

### 2021-AUG-23

* Reduced the set of fields returned by orders in "pending" status for `GET /orders`, `GET /orders/<id>`, and `GET /orders/client:<client_oid>` APIs. See `List Orders` documentation for more details. Orders with non-pending statuses will be unaffected by this change.

### 2021-AUG-17

* Return client order ID rather than order ID in successful cancel order response for REST API endpoint `DELETE /orders/client:<client_oid>`.

### 2021-AUG-12

* Require the field Symbol(55) on the following FIX API messages: OrderCancelRequest(F) and OrderStatusRequest(H). Messages (F) and (H) without Symbol(55) will be rejected.

### 2021-AUG-06

* Add pagination support for the `GET /fills` endpoint.

### 2021-AUG-01

* Increased the maximum number of FIX connections allowed per profile from 5 to 7.

### 2021-JUL-01

* Added sendingTime 5 minute validation.

### 2021-JUN-22

* Added fx\_stablecoin to products.

### 2021-JUN-21

* Order Cancel Batch Request(U4) will accept optional ClOrdID(11) field for each cancel request. The provided ClOrdID(11) will be included in Order Cancel Reject(9) for partial reject.

### 2021-JUN-14

* Order Cancel Batch Request(U4) will now return Order Cancel Reject(9) for partial rejected cancel request.

### 2021-JUN-10

* Added failed status to reports.

### 2021-JUN-03

* Our API endpoints were moved to `exchange.coinbase.com` from `prime.coinbase.com`.
