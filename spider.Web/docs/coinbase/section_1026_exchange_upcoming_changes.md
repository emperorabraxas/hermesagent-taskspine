## Removing SenderSubID (50) from Execution Reports (8)

*Updated: 2026-Mar-09*

*To Be Released: 2026-Mar-12*

On March 12th at 18:00 UTC (2:00 PM EST) we will be deploying a change to our FIX engines to remove the SenderSubID (50) = TEST that is returned on every execution report from the exchange. TEST does not represent a value that should be used in anyway and SenderSubID (50) is marked as optional in the data dictionaries that can be downloaded in our documentation.

Please note all the other tags and values for execution reports will not be changed and can be found here: [https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5#executionreport-35=8](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5#executionreport-35=8)

## SL/TPSL Order Cancel Replace Support

*Updated: 2025-Dec-02*

*To Be Released: 2025-Dec-04*

We are expanding [OrderCancelReplaceRequest (35=G)](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5#ordercancelreplacerequest-35=g) to support additional order types. Currently, this message only supports limit orders. With this update, you will also be able to modify stop orders and [TPSL (Take Profit/Stop Loss)](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/tpsl-orders) orders using the cancel-replace workflow.

## Deleting travel rule fields in POST /withdrawals/crypto REST API

*Updated: 2025-Jan-13*

We are removing travel rule fields from `POST /withdrawals/crypto` REST API. Customers in travel rule jurisdictions can withdraw only to their allowlisted addresses.

## Adding new PUT /address-book/<u>\{id}</u> REST endpoint

*Added: 2025-Jan-8*

We are introducing a new REST endpoint to edit an editing existing address book entry - useful for customers in travel rule jurisdictions.
This endpoint requires the API key to have <b>MANAGE</b> permissions.

Non travel-rule jurisdictions can only edit the label of the address book entry.

Example request `PUT https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/address-book/{id}`. Here <u>\{id}</u> refers to uuid of the crypto address.

```
{
  "label": "string", // label for crypto address
  "is_certified_self_send": bool // true if customer owns the address/ false if it is a third party address
  "vasp_id": "string" // optional - vasp name from supported list if the wallet address is a VASP address
  "is_verified_self_hosted_wallet": bool // optional - true if the wallet is verified self-hosted wallet
  "business_name": "lorem ipsum", // required for third-party address; ie is_certified_self_send is false
  "business_country_code": "DE" // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code required for third-party address; ie is_certified_self_send is false
}
```

Sample response:
