## System Components

### REST Entry Gateways

* Requests are routed through Cloudflare.
* Requests are processed on a FIFO basis with no queuing.
* REST requires additional authentication because it's stateless (as opposed to FIX order gateways, which authenticate during login).

### FIX Order Gateways

* Each instance contains a per-user product based queue.
* Each per-user product-based queue can hold a maximum of 50 queued requests before requests are rejected.
* Each per-user product-based queue is processed on a FIFO basis.

### Order Entry Gateway (Risk System)

* Each instance processes requests from FIX Order Gateways and REST in real time with no queuing.
* System performs real-time risk checks and account collateralization.

### Trade Engine

* Clustered service that guarantees FIFO sequencing at a product level.
* Processes all requests from Order Entry Gateway.
* Publishes market data to WebSocket / FIX Market Data.

### Market Data (Websocket & FIX)

* Each instance can process all market data requests across all products.
* Messages are distributed to customers randomly, and there is no intended benefit to being “first to subscribe”.
