# Exchange WebSocket Overview
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/exchange/websocket-feed/overview



The WebSocket feed is publicly available and provides real-time market data updates for orders and trades. Two endpoints are supported in both production and sandbox:

* **Coinbase Market Data** is our traditional feed which is available without authentication.
* **Coinbase Direct Market Data** has direct access to Coinbase Exchange servers and requires [Authentication](/exchange/websocket-feed/authentication).

<Tip>
  You can subscribe to both endpoints, but if `ws-direct` is your primary connection, we recommend using `ws-feed` as a failover.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Coinbase Market Data**<br />
  production = `wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com` <br />
  sandbox = `wss://ws-feed-public.sandbox.exchange.coinbase.com` <br /><br />

  **Coinbase Direct Market Data**<br />
  production = `wss://ws-direct.exchange.coinbase.com` <br />
  sandbox = `wss://ws-direct.sandbox.exchange.coinbase.com`
</Info>

## Protocol

The WebSocket feed uses a bidirectional protocol that encodes all messages as JSON objects. All messages have a `type` attribute that can be used to handle the message appropriately.

<Tip>
  New message types can be added at any time. Clients are expected to ignore messages they do not support.
</Tip>

## Subscribe

To begin receiving feed messages, you must send a `subscribe` message to the server indicating which channels and products to receive. This message is mandatory—you are disconnected if no `subscribe` has been received within 5 seconds.

<Warning>
  To receive feed messages, you must send a `subscribe` message or you are disconnected in 5 seconds.
</Warning>

```json lines wrap theme={null}
// Request
// Subscribe to ETH-USD and ETH-EUR with the level2, heartbeat and ticker channels,
// plus receive the ticker entries for ETH-BTC and ETH-USD
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "ETH-EUR"],
  "channels": [
    "level2",
    "heartbeat",
    {
      "name": "ticker",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-BTC", "ETH-USD"]
    }
  ]
}
```

You receive a `subscriptions` message as a response to an `subscribe` message.

### Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe from channel/product pairs, send an `unsubscribe` message. The structure is equivalent to `subscribe` messages.

<Tip>
  You can also unsubscribe from a channel entirely by providing no product IDs.
</Tip>

```json lines wrap theme={null}
// Request
{
  "type": "unsubscribe",
  "channels": ["heartbeat"]
}
```

You receive a `subscriptions` message as a response to an `unsubscribe` message.

### Specifying Product IDs

There are two ways to specify the product IDs to listen for within each channel:

* You can define product IDs for an individual channel.
* You can define product IDs at the root of the object—this adds them to all the channels you subscribe to.

```json lines wrap theme={null}
// Request
{
  "type": "unsubscribe",
  "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "ETH-EUR"],
  "channels": ["ticker"]
}
```

### Subscriptions Message

A `subscriptions` message is sent in response to both [subscribe](#subscribe) and [unsubscribe](#unsubscribe) messages.

In response to a `subscribe` message, the `subscriptions` message lists all channels you are subscribed to. Subsequent subscribe messages add to the list of subscriptions. If you subscribed to a channel without being authenticated, you will remain in the unauthenticated channel.

```json lines wrap theme={null}
// Response
{
  "type": "subscriptions",
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "level2",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "ETH-EUR"]
    },
    {
      "name": "heartbeat",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "ETH-EUR"]
    },
    {
      "name": "ticker",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "ETH-EUR", "ETH-BTC"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Websocket Compression Extension

Websocket compression, defined in RFC7692, compresses the payload of WebSocket messages which can increase total throughput and potentially reduce message delivery latency. The **permessage-deflate extension** can be enabled by adding the extension header. Currently, it is not possible to specify the compression level.

From [RFC7692](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7692#section-7.1.3):

The simplest "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header in a client (or server's) opening handshake to offer (or accept) use of the "permessage-deflate" extension looks like this:

```
GET wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate
```

## Sequence Numbers

Most feed messages contain a sequence number. Sequence numbers are increasing integer values for each product, with each new message being exactly one sequence number greater than the one before it.

Sequence numbers that are *greater than one integer value* from the previous number indicate that a message has been dropped. Sequence numbers that are *less* than the previous number can be ignored or represent a message that has arrived out of order.

In either situation you may need to perform logic to make sure your system is in the correct state.

<Warning>
  Even though a WebSocket connection is over TCP, the WebSocket servers receive market data in a manner that can result in dropped messages. Your feed consumer should be designed to handle sequence gaps and out of order messages, or should use channels that guarantee delivery of messages.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  To guarantee that messages are delivered and your order book is in sync, consider using the [level2 channel](/exchange/websocket-feed/channels#level2-channel).
</Tip>

## End-to-end Example

Below is an end-to-end example for Python that handles authentication and connection to the Exchange WebSocket. This code sample can be cloned at [Coinbase Samples](https://github.com/coinbase-samples/exchange-scripts-py/tree/main/websocket).

```python [expandable] lines wrap theme={null}

import asyncio, base64, hashlib, hmac, json, os, time, websockets

API_KEY = str(os.environ.get('API_KEY'))
PASSPHRASE = str(os.environ.get('PASSPHRASE'))
SECRET_KEY = str(os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY'))

URI = 'wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com'
SIGNATURE_PATH = '/users/self/verify'

channel = 'level2'
product_ids = 'ETH-USD'


async def generate_signature():
    timestamp = str(time.time())
    message = f'{timestamp}GET{SIGNATURE_PATH}'
    hmac_key = base64.b64decode(SECRET_KEY)
    signature = hmac.new(
        hmac_key,
        message.encode('utf-8'),
        digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
    signature_b64 = base64.b64encode(signature).decode().rstrip('\n')
    return signature_b64, timestamp


async def websocket_listener():
    signature_b64, timestamp = await generate_signature()
    subscribe_message = json.dumps({
        'type': 'subscribe',
        'channels': [{'name': channel, 'product_ids': [product_ids]}],
        'signature': signature_b64,
        'key': API_KEY,
        'passphrase': PASSPHRASE,
        'timestamp': timestamp
    })

    while True:
        try:
            async with websockets.connect(URI, ping_interval=None) as websocket:
                await websocket.send(subscribe_message)
                while True:
                    response = await websocket.recv()
                    json_response = json.loads(response)
                    print(json_response)

        except (websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError, websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedOK):
            print('Connection closed, retrying..')
            await asyncio.sleep(1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        asyncio.run(websocket_listener())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Exiting WebSocket..")

```
