# Debugging AI-Generated Code
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/develop-with-ai/development/ai-debugging



## Overview

When you're building crypto apps with AI help, things often go wrong with wallets, network connections, and transactions. This guide shows you a simple, step-by-step way to debug these issues.

**Here's how to debug effectively using AI:**

* **Isolate**: Create a simple example that shows the exact problem
* **Analyze**: Give the AI context about your app and what you were trying to do
* **Fix**: Ask for a solution that's secure and handles edge cases
* **Prevent**: Get tests written so this bug doesn't happen again

## Debug prompt template

**Here's a template you can copy and fill in:**

```
"Debug this issue in my [app type]:

Error: [exact message]
Expected vs Actual: [one line]
Environment: [browser/network/wallet]

Minimal code:
[paste tiny repro]

Please provide:
1) Likely root cause(s)
2) Corrected code
3) Safer pattern to avoid this
4) Tests to prevent regression (framework: [Jest/Vitest])"
```

## Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Isolate">
    **Copy this prompt:**

    ```
    "Issue with [functionality]:

    Expected: [expected behavior]
    Actual: [actual behavior]
    Error: [exact error message]
    Environment: [browser/network/wallet]

    Minimal code: [paste minimal example]"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Analyze">
    **Copy this prompt:**

    ```
    "Context for this issue:

    App type: [wallet/DeFi/trading]
    User flow: [what user was doing]
    Recent changes: [what changed]
    Similar working code: [paste if any]

    Could any of these factors contribute?"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Fix">
    **Copy this prompt:**

    ```
    "Need a solution that:
    1. Fixes the immediate issue
    2. Follows security best practices
    3. Handles edge cases like [specific cases]
    4. Integrates with existing patterns

    Provide corrected code with explanations."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Prevent">
    **Copy this prompt:**

    ```
    "Create tests for this fix:

    Fixed code: [paste solution]
    Test scenarios: [edge cases to cover]
    Framework: [Jest/Vitest]

    Generate tests covering the bug and related cases."
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to prevent bugs

### Always review AI code

**Use this prompt to get the AI to check its own work:**

```
"Review your generated code for:
- Common crypto development mistakes
- Security vulnerabilities  
- Performance issues
- Integration problems

Provide critical analysis and improvements."
```

### Generate tests with code

**Ask for tests when you request features:**

```
"Generate [feature] with comprehensive tests:

Requirements: [feature needs]
Context: [existing code]

Provide implementation plus unit/integration/error tests."
```

### Ask for explanations

**Don't just ask for code, ask the AI to explain its decisions:**

```
"Implement [feature] with detailed explanations:

Requirements: [needs]
Context: [existing code]

Explain each major decision and potential issues."
```

## Common crypto app errors

### Transaction errors

**When transactions fail, try this:**

```
Pattern: "execution reverted" or "transaction failed"
Causes: Insufficient gas, invalid parameters, network congestion

Debug: "Transaction reverting: [error]. Details: [transaction object]. Help identify why."
```

### Connection errors

**When wallets won't connect, try this:**

```
Pattern: "wallet not connected" or "provider not found"  
Causes: Missing extension, wrong network, state management issues

Debug: "Users can't connect: [error]. Code: [connection logic]. What to check?"
```

### State errors

**When your app's state gets messed up, try this:**

```
Pattern: "Cannot read property of undefined" or infinite re-renders
Causes: Missing dependencies, race conditions, memory leaks

Debug: "State management issues: [symptoms]. Code: [component]. Fix patterns?"
```

## More debugging tips

### Compare working vs broken code

**Try this when you have a working example:**

```
"My code isn't working: [paste broken code]

Working example: [paste working code or link]

What's different and why might mine fail? How should I fix it?"
```

### Break down complex problems

**When the issue is complicated, try debugging piece by piece:**

```
"Complex issue with [feature]:

Part 1 - Basic functionality: [code] - Does this work?
Part 2 - Integration: [describe] - How should this integrate?
Part 3 - Edge cases: [describe] - What cases to handle?

Debug each part systematically."
```

### When something breaks later

**If your feature worked before but now it's broken:**

```
"Feature worked before but now broken:

Last working: [commit/description]
Current error: [error message]
Recent changes: [list changes]

What change likely caused this regression?"
```
