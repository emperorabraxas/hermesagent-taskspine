Essential prompting patterns for generating high-quality crypto code with AI assistants

## Overview

Effective prompting is the foundation of AI-first crypto development. This guide covers proven approaches and recommended patterns that help generate production-quality code and handle complex blockchain scenarios efficiently.

## Core approaches

### Context layering

Build context progressively from general to specific:

```
"I'm building a consumer crypto wallet using CDP embedded wallets and Next.js.

The app uses CDP Web SDK and OnchainKit components. Here's my current structure: [paste code]

Add a send money feature with email notifications for recipients without wallets."
```

### Error-driven development

Use errors as learning opportunities:

```
"I'm getting this error: [exact error message]

Code: [paste code]
Goal: [what I was trying to achieve]

Fix this and explain why it happened so I can avoid similar issues."
```

**Key elements:**

* Exact error messages (don't paraphrase)
* Complete code context
* Clear intent
* Ask for explanations

### Comparative analysis

Get AI to compare approaches:

```
"I need to implement [functionality]. I'm considering:

Approach A: [description]
Approach B: [description]

Which would you recommend for [app type] and why? Consider security, UX, and complexity."
```

## Crypto-specific patterns

### Wallet integration

```
"Integrate [wallet type] with my [app description].

Requirements:
- [user flows]
- [security needs]
- [network support]

Handle: connection states, network switching, error recovery, mobile compatibility."
```

### Transaction flows

```
"Design a transaction flow for [action].

User journey: [steps]
Constraints: [gas limits, network]
Security: [validation requirements]

Include user feedback, error handling, and status tracking."
```

## Recommended patterns

### Build in stages

Start simple, then improve:

**First, get it working:**

```
"Create basic [feature] for CDP app. Focus on core functionality."
```

**Then, make it better:**

```
"Improve this implementation: [paste code]
Add error handling, loading states, validation."
```

**Finally, polish it up:**

```
"Optimize for production: [paste code]
Focus on performance, security, testing."
```

### Ask for different perspectives

Get focused feedback by asking the AI to wear different "hats":

**For architecture decisions:** "Focus only on high-level design decisions and system integration."

**For implementation:** "Write clean, performant code. Assume architecture is decided."

**For security review:** "Review only for vulnerabilities and compliance issues."

## Best practices

### Do

* Be specific with requirements and context
* Include exact error messages and code
* Ask for explanations, not just solutions
* Build complexity incrementally

### Don't

* Use vague requests like "make it better"
* Skip project context
* Accept code without review
* Rush through complex features
