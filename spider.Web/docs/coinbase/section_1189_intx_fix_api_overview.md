# INTX FIX API Overview
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/international-exchange/fix-api/fix-api-overview



[Financial Information eXchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange), or FIX, is a standard protocol which can be used to enter orders, submit cancel requests, and receive fills. FIX API users typically have existing software that runs FIX for order management.

The baseline specification for the INTX FIX API is [FIX 5.0](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/5.0/index.html).

## Supported Endpoints

**Production**

* Order Entry: `tcp+ssl://fix.international.coinbase.com:6110`<br />
* Market Data: `tcp+ssl://fix.international.coinbase.com:6120`<br />
* Drop Copy: `tcp+ssl://fix.international.coinbase.com:6130`<br />

**Sandbox**

* Order Entry: `tcp+ssl://n5e2.coinbase.com:6110`<br />
* Market Data: `tcp+ssl://n5e2.coinbase.com:6120`<br />
* Drop Copy: `tcp+ssl://n5e2.coinbase.com:6130`<br />

<Warning>
  Resend Requests
  Resend requests are not supported. Every connection establishes a new session and a new set of session sequence numbers.
</Warning>

## FIX Gateway

Before logging onto a FIX session, clients must establish a secure connection to the FIX gateway. See the [available endpoints](#endpoints) above.

**TCP SSL**

If your FIX implementation does not support establishing a **native TCP SSL connection**, you must setup a local proxy such as [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org) to establish a secure connection to the FIX gateway.

**AWS IP**

If connecting from servers **outside of AWS** which require firewall rules, use the [AWS provided resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) to determine how best to allowlist AWS IP ranges.

## Ciphers

Coinbase Exchange supports **TLSv1.2** with the following server ciphers:

| Recommend | Length   | Cipher Suite                | Elliptic Curve      |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Preferred | 128 bits | ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | Curve P-256 DHE 256 |
| Accepted  | 128 bits | ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256     | Curve P-256 DHE 256 |
| Accepted  | 256 bits | ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 | Curve P-256 DHE 256 |
| Accepted  | 256 bits | ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384     | Curve P-256 DHE 256 |

## Sequence Numbers

The exchange resets the sequences weekly on Saturday at 12:00 CDT. Resets may also be initiated by a firm sending a Logon message with `ResetSeqNumFlag=Y`.
