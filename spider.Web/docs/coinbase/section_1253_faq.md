## General

### What is Payments MCP?

An MCP server + wallet app that lets AI agents autonomously pay for x402 services using USDC.

### Do I need API keys?

No. Authentication happens through your embedded wallet (email/OTP), and payments are automatic via x402.

### What tokens are supported?

USDC on Base network.

### How much does it cost?

* Payments MCP: Free
* Wallet creation: Free
* Gas fees: Free (sponsored)
* x402 service calls: Varies by service
* Coinbase Onramp: Standard fees apply

### Is this custodial?

No. You control your embedded wallet through email/OTP. Coinbase doesn't have custody of your funds.

## Wallet & Payments

### How do I add funds?

1. Ask your agent: `Show me my wallet`
2. Sign in with email/OTP
3. Click **Fund**
4. Follow Coinbase Onramp flow

### What if I lose access to my email?

Your wallet is tied to your email. Work with your email provider to recover access. Use an email you control.

### How do spending limits work?

Set them manually in the wallet UI:

* **Max per call:** Max for a single payment (e.g., \$0.05)
* **Max per session:** Total session limit (e.g., \$5.00)

Agents respect these limits but can't change them.

### What if a payment fails?

No funds are deducted. Common reasons:

* Insufficient balance
* Network issues
* Service unavailable

Your agent will notify you and can retry.

### Can I get refunds?

x402 payments are instant and onchain. Refunds depend on the service provider. Contact them directly.
