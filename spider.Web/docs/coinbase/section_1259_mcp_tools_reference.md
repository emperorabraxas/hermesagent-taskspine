# MCP Tools Reference
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/payments-mcp/tools-reference



Your AI agent can use these tools to manage your wallet and make payments. You talk to your agent in natural language—the agent uses these tools behind the scenes.

## Wallet tools

### Get wallet address

Returns your wallet address.

**Try:**

```
What's my wallet address?
```

***

### Get wallet balance

Shows your token balances (USDC, etc.).

**Try:**

```
What's my wallet balance?
```

```
How much USDC do I have?
```

***

### Show wallet app

Opens the wallet interface where you can:

* Sign in with email/OTP
* Browse the **Bazaar** tab to explore x402 services, filter by category/price, and copy prompts
* Add funds via Coinbase Onramp
* View transaction history
* Configure spending limits

**Try:**

```
Show me my wallet
```

***

### Check sign-in status

Checks if you're signed in and provides next steps if not.

**Try:**

```
Am I signed in?
```

**Note:** This runs automatically when your agent starts.

## Payment tools

### List Bazaar resources

Discovers available x402 services (APIs, data sources, etc.) that your agent can pay for.

**Try:**

```
What x402 services are available?
```

```
List services for onchain token data
```

**Returns:** Service names, descriptions, pricing, and quality scores.

***

### Get details about a resource

Gets full documentation for a specific service including API structure, parameters, and payment requirements.

**Try:**

```
Get details for the weather API
```

**Note:** Your agent calls this before making payments to understand how to use the service.

***

### Make an x402 request

Makes an API call and handles payment automatically. This is how your agent pays for services.

**Try:**

```
Get the most up to date crypto and AI news
```

```
Scrape product reviews for iPhone 15
```

**What happens:**

1. Agent discovers payment requirements
2. Sends USDC payment
3. Calls the API
4. Returns results

**Payment details:**

* Uses USDC on Base network
* No gas fees (sponsored)
* Must be within your spending limits

***

### Check payment requirements for a resource

Checks what payment an endpoint requires without actually paying. Useful for non-bazaar services.

**Try:**

```
What does this API cost to use?
```

**Note:** For bazaar services, use `bazaar_get_resource_details` instead; it includes more info.

## What agents CAN'T do

These features exist in the wallet UI, but agents cannot access them. Only you can:

### Set spending limits

Configure max spend per call and per session in the wallet UI. Agents respect these limits but can't change them.

### Transfer funds

Send USDC to other addresses. Agents can only pay for x402 services, not send to arbitrary addresses.

### Add funds

Use Coinbase Onramp to add USDC. Agents can't initiate onramp flows.
