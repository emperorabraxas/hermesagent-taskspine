# Activities
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/prime/concepts/activities



Activities are auditable events generated for any action within a Prime account. This includes transactions (e.g., withdrawals or transfers), user management (e.g., adding or removing users), API key creation, staking operations, and more. For API users, activities provide an extra layer of reconciliation by logging every significant event in the account.

Additionally, each activity can link directly to the Prime UI, where consensus approval (or rejection) might be required before finalizing certain actions. Many API responses include both an Activity ID and a unique hyperlink to that activity in the Prime UI.

To list activities, begin by calling [List Activities](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/activities/list-activities). The example 200 response in the documentation breaks down all possible activity types and fields returned.
