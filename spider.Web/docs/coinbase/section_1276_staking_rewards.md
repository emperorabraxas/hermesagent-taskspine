# Staking Rewards
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/prime/concepts/staking/staking-rewards



Staking-related transaction events can be tracked using either the [List Portfolio Transactions](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/list-portfolio-transactions) or [List Wallet Transactions](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/list-wallet-transactions) endpoints. Both endpoints return identical response structures; the wallet-level endpoint simply scopes the results to a single wallet.

These APIs can be used to monitor staking lifecycle events (e.g., initiation, exit) and to track reward distribution over time. For all non-ETH assets, rewards are deposited directly into the wallet from which the asset was staked.

## Tracking Rewards

To track all reward distributions over time, use the [List Portfolio Transactions](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/list-portfolio-transactions) or [List Wallet Transactions](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/list-wallet-transactions) endpoints and filter for `REWARD` transaction type.

Below is an example of querying for staking rewards at the portfolio level.

## Rewards by Asset

### Solana (SOL)

**Balance Types**

| Balance Type          | Calculation                    | Conditions                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bondable_amount`     | Spendable - pending delegation | Returns 0 if already bonded since the wallet is already staking. Excludes a small amount to ensure that the account is in good standing. |
| `bonded_amount`       | staked + pending delegation    | Sum of active + pending stakes                                                                                                           |
| `unbonding_amount`    | pending undelegation           | SOL has a cooldown after the unstake tx is processed                                                                                     |
| `withdrawable_amount` | total - staking                | Withdrawals are subject to Solana's rent-exempt minimum; approximately 0.0023 SOL must remain in the account.                            |

**Rewards**

* **MEV Rewards** are distributed as liquid SOL and increase the Withdrawable balance. The Withdrawable balance only appears once the total exceeds 0.05 SOL.
* **Inflationary Rewards** are automatically added to stake. Once distributed, they increase the Bonded balance.
* **Block Reward Sweeps** are a special category of rewards, only distributed to clients running dedicated validators.
* Rewards accrue at the epoch boundary; timing of availability is dependent on Solana's epoch schedule.

### Ethereum (ETH)

**Balance Types**

| Balance Type        | Calculation                           | Conditions                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bondable_amount`   | Withdrawable balance                  | Returns 0 for Staking Transaction Rewards wallet. Requires minimum 32 ETH                                          |
| `bonded_amount`     | Pulled from validator status directly | Requires at least one validator active                                                                             |
| `unbonding_amount`  | Pulled from validator status directly | Represents funds awaiting exit but not yet withdrawable; exits may take multiple days depending on validator queue |
| `unbondable_amount` | Pulled from validator status directly | Validator status should be active for 256 epochs                                                                   |

**Rewards**

ETH staking rewards are earned in the form of Consensus Layer and Execution Layer rewards.

* **Consensus Layer Rewards** autocompound up to a maximum effective balance of 2,048 ETH per validator. Once this threshold is reached, additional rewards are swept directly to the vault wallet that was staked.
* **Execution Layer Rewards** (MEV and Transaction Rewards) are paid out to the Staking Transaction Rewards wallet as liquid ETH and are not automatically staked.

For details on claiming rewards and tracking unstaking progress, see [Staking Lifecycle](/prime/concepts/staking/staking-lifecycle).

* Any rewards that are earned but not yet distributed are reflected in the Pending Rewards field.
