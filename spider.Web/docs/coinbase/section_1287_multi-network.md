# Multi-Network
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/prime/concepts/transactions/multinetwork



Coinbase Prime supports sending and receiving assets across multiple blockchain networks. This multi-network functionality enables faster and more flexible capital movement for supported assets such as USDC, ETH, and BTC.

## Understanding Multi-Network Balances

Prime maintains consolidated trading balances for each asset, regardless of which network deposits or withdrawals occur on. When you use the Prime Trading Balance, all network-level activity is aggregated into a single asset balance.

For example, if you deposit 1 USDC on Ethereum and 1 USDC on Base, you'll see:

* Two separate transaction records, each with its own network-specific symbol (`usdc` and `baseusdc`)
* A combined balance of 2 USDC in your USDC trading balance

Similarly, depositing 1 cbBTC on Base into your Trading Balance will increase your BTC balance by 1 BTC.

This approach lets you move capital freely across networks while avoiding operational overhead such as wallet consolidation or managing network-specific fee tokens.

## Supported Assets and Networks

Prime currently supports multi-network functionality for the following assets:

| Asset | Network           | Network-Scoped Symbol |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| USDC  | Ethereum          | `usdc`                |
| USDC  | Avalanche C-Chain | `avausdc`             |
| USDC  | Optimism          | `optusdc`             |
| USDC  | Base              | `baseusdc`            |
| USDC  | Solana            | `splusdc`             |
| USDC  | Arbitrum          | `arbusdc`             |
| ETH   | Ethereum          | `eth`                 |
| ETH   | Base              | `baseeth`             |
| BTC   | Ethereum          | `cbbtc`               |
| BTC   | Base              | `basecbbtc`           |

Please note not every network will be available across all jurisdictions that Prime supports.

## Network-Scoped Symbols

To distinguish assets on different networks, Prime uses **network-scoped symbols**. These symbols appear in transaction records and API responses to indicate which specific network an asset is associated with.

When calling the [List Assets](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/assets/list-assets) endpoint, the response includes `network_details` for each supported network, with a unique `network_scoped_symbol` for each network where the asset is available.

For example, a subset of the USDC response includes:

* `usdc` for Ethereum
* `baseusdc` for Base
* `optusdc` for Optimism

It is therefore important that when building reconciliation, accounting, and send/receive functionality, you take into consideration the need to normalize these symbols given the unified nature of the Prime trading balance.

## Working with Network-Specific Data

Many Prime API endpoints now include network information and filtering capabilities:

### Transactions and Activities

When working with transactions, you can typically filter by network-scoped symbols to isolate activity for a specific asset-network pair:

* **[List Portfolio Transactions](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/list-portfolio-transactions)** - Returns `network` field for onchain transactions
* **[Get Transaction by ID](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/get-transaction-by-transaction-id)** - Returns `network` field for onchain transactions
* **[List Entity Activities](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/activities/list-entity-activities)** - Filter activities using `symbols` parameter with network-scoped symbols
* **[Create Withdrawal](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/transactions/create-withdrawal)** - Accepts optional `network` parameter to specify the destination network for onchain withdrawals. When left out, the withdrawal will default to the default network for a given asset, which is specified by data included in [List Assets](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/assets/list-assets).

### Wallets

Wallet endpoints now include network information for vault wallets:

* **[List Portfolio Wallets](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/wallets/list-portfolio-wallets)** - Returns `network` field for vault wallets
* **[Get Wallet by ID](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/wallets/get-wallet-by-wallet-id)** - Returns `network` field for vault wallets
* **[Create Wallet](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/wallets/create-wallet)** - Accepts optional `network` parameter for vault wallets
* **[Get Wallet Deposit Instructions](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/wallets/get-wallet-deposit-instructions)** - Accepts optional `network` parameter and returns `network` field for onchain deposits
* **[Create Wallet Deposit Address](/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/wallets/create-wallet-deposit-address)** - Requires network and generates a network-specific deposit address
