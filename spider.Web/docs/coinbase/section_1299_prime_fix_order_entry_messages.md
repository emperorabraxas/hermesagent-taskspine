# Prime FIX Order Entry Messages
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/prime/fix-api/order-entry-messages



The baseline specification for this API is [FIX 4.2](https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/fix-4-2/). Below, we've noted the places in which the FIX API for Coinbase Prime extends (or clarifies) the FIX spec. For example, there are custom tags with a four-digit number range, as allowed by the standard, which are unique to Prime.

For standard header configuration requirements, see [Administrative Messages](/prime/fix-api/admin-messages).

## New Order Single (D)

## RFQ

### Quote Request (R)

A Quote Request (R) is the start of the RFQ process. Coinbase Prime sends a Quote Request to Liquidity Providers (LPs) on behalf of a customer looking to participate in an RFQ trade. LPs respond to a Quote Request (R) with a Quote (S).

## Order Cancel/Replace Request (G)

<Warning>
  This message type is in beta, please reach out to your Technical Account Manager for early access to this functionality.
</Warning>

Order Modification Request) is used to amend replaceable [fields](https://help.coinbase.com/en/prime/trading-and-funding/editing-orders-on-prime) on open **LIMIT**, **STOP-LIMIT**, **TWAP**, and **VWAP** orders. Orders are modified with “in-flight mitigation” meaning any partially filled quantity on the original order is carried over to the edited order and is reflected in the edited order’s remaining quantity `LeavesQty (151)`.

#### Usage Notes

* Identifiers: Used for sequencing edits.
  * `OrigClOrdID (41)` – The identifier of the current active order you intend to modify. This must match the existing order’s `ClOrdID (11)`.
  * `ClOrdID (11)` – The new identifier representing the edited order’s state. This value must be unique and **cannot match** `OrigClOrdID (41)`.

* Execution Reports: Each modification triggers `Execution Report (MsgType=8)` messages with the following `ExecType (150)` values:
  * `E` – **Pending Replace** (acknowledgment that the modification is being processed)
  * `5` – **Replaced** (confirmation that the modification has been applied)

* Editing TWAP orders: We strongly recommend against aggressively increasing the order amount or significantly shortening the duration of active TWAP orders. The TWAP algorithm will adopt the new instructions and may execute more aggressively to catch up to the revised parameters.

* Edit limit:  A single order may be edited up to **25 times**.

## Order Status Request (H)
