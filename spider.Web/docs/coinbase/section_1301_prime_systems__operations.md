## System Components

### REST Entry Gateways

* Requests are routed through Cloudflare.
* Requests are load-balanced across available instances.
* REST requires per-request authentication headers and signature; FIX authentication happens at session login.

### FIX Order Gateways

* Each instance contains a per-user product based queue.
* Each per-user product-based queue is processed on a FIFO basis.

### Smart Order Router

* Routes orders across multiple connected liquidity venues to achieve best execution.
* Aggregates liquidity from multiple venues into unified order books for each trading pair.
* Supports venue filtering and the option to enable venue fee transparency.
