Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/prime/rest-api/rate-limits



The REST API throttles endpoints by IP address **AND** portfolio ID:

* IP address at 100 requests per second (rps). If you exceed 100 rps, a 429 error is thrown and you have to wait 30 seconds before resuming.

* Portfolio ID at 25 rps with a burst of 50 rps.
