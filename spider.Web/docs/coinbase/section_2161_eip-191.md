# EIP-191
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/server-wallets/v2/evm-features/eip-191-signing



## Overview

Message signing allows you to apply a unique cryptographic signature to verify your identity on EVM networks.

Using the [CDP-SDK](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk), developers can enable signing of messages with the EIP-191 standard, which prepends messages with a standard prefix before signing. This ensures messages are easily distinguishable from transaction data and provides a secure way to prove ownership of an address.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

* Create an EVM account
* Sign a message using EIP-191 standard

## Prerequisites

It is assumed you have already completed the [Quickstart](/server-wallets/v2/introduction/quickstart) guide.

## 1. Create an account

To create an account, see below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts main.ts lines wrap  theme={null}
  import { CdpClient } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk";
  import "dotenv/config";
    
  const cdp = new CdpClient();
    
  const account = await cdp.evm.createAccount();
    
  console.log("Successfully created account: ", account.address);
  ```

  ```python main.py lines wrap  theme={null}
  import asyncio
  from cdp import CdpClient
  import dotenv
    
  dotenv.load_dotenv()
    
  async def main():
      cdp = CdpClient()
    
      account = await cdp.evm.create_account()
      print(f"Successfully created account: {account.address}")
    
      await cdp.close()
    
    
  asyncio.run(main())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After running the above snippet, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Successfully created account: 0x6aAEc7535706ce8B36ea184B2236D53702c1F06A
```

## 2. Sign message

The v2 Server Wallet supports [EIP-191](/api-reference/v2/rest-api/evm-accounts/sign-an-eip-191-message) message signing, which provides a standardized way to sign messages on Ethereum. Per the specification, the message is prepended with `\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n` followed by the message length before being signed.

  ### What is EIP-191?

  EIP-191 is a standard for signing messages in Ethereum that helps prevent signed messages from being confused with signed transactions. It defines a structured format for signed data that includes:

  * A magic byte `0x19` to ensure the data could never be a valid RLP-encoded transaction
  * The string "Ethereum Signed Message:\n"
  * The length of the message
  * The actual message content

  ### Use Cases

  EIP-191 signed messages are commonly used for:

  * **Authentication**: Proving ownership of an address without making a transaction
  * **Off-chain agreements**: Signing terms of service or other agreements
  * **Message verification**: Allowing others to verify that a specific address signed a message
  * **Login systems**: Implementing "Sign in with Ethereum" functionality

  ### Security Benefits

  * Messages cannot be replayed as transactions
  * Clear separation between transaction signing and message signing
  * Human-readable messages instead of raw hashes
  * Protection against phishing attacks by showing users what they're signing

Here is a complete example showing how to sign a message using EIP-191:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts main.ts lines wrap [expandable] theme={null}
  import { CdpClient } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk";  
  import "dotenv/config";  
    
  const cdp = new CdpClient();
    
  const account = await cdp.evm.createAccount();
  console.log("Created account:", account.address);
    
  const message = "Hello, Coinbase Developer Platform!";
  const signature = await cdp.evm.signMessage({
    address: account.address,
    message
  });
    
  console.log("Message:", message);
  console.log("Signature:", signature);

  // The signature can be verified by anyone to prove the account signed the message
  ```

  ```python main.py lines wrap [expandable]  theme={null}
  import asyncio
    
  from cdp import CdpClient
    
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
    
  load_dotenv()
    
  async def main():
      cdp = CdpClient()
    
      account = await cdp.evm.create_account()
      print(f"Created account: {account.address}")
    
      message = "Hello, Coinbase Developer Platform!"
      signature = await cdp.evm.sign_message(
          address=account.address,
          message=message
      )
      
      print(f"Message: {message}")
      print(f"Signature: {signature}")
      
      # The signature can be verified by anyone to prove the account signed the message
    
      await cdp.close()


  asyncio.run(main())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After running the above snippet, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Created account: 0x2Ae896e791c9596c7beDeCC3E06Fa6DA9aE2B193  
Message: Hello, Coinbase Developer Platform!
Signature: 0x1b0c9cf8cd4554c6c6d9e7311e88f1be075d7f25b418a044f4bf2c0a42a93e212ad0a8b54de9e0b5f7e3812de3f2c6cc79aa8c3e1c02e7ad14b4a8f42012c2c01b    
```

To summarize, in the example above, we:

* Created an EVM account
* Signed a plain text message using EIP-191 standard
* The message was automatically prepended with the EIP-191 prefix before signing
* Generated a cryptographic signature that can be used to verify the signer's identity

The EIP-191 standard ensures that signed messages cannot be confused with transaction data, providing a secure way to prove ownership of an address.

## Verifying Signatures

Once you have a signature, it can be verified by anyone to confirm that the message was signed by the claimed address. This is useful for authentication systems, proving ownership, or validating off-chain agreements.
