# Server Wallet Pricing
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/server-wallets/v2/introduction/pricing



## Overview

Server Wallet features a flexible, usage-based pricing model. This means you only pay for what you use, offering the benefit of no up-front subscription costs or long-term contracts.

Developers are charged for the number of `Wallet operations` that are consumed.
Wallet operations include wallet creation, transaction signing, transaction broadcast, and policy evaluations.

We only charge for write operations; all read operations are completely free.

To help you estimate costs, the following table outlines the number of Wallet operations associated with various common actions.
