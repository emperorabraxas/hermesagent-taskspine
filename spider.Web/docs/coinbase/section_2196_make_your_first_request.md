Coinbase Staking API empowers developers to deliver a fully-featured staking experience in their applications using one common interface across protocols.

This quickstart shows you how to stake Hoodi (an Ethereum testnet) ETH to our best-in-class staking infrastructure using the Coinbase Staking API.

### What you will learn

* Installing the CDP SDK
* How to check your stakeable balance
* How to create a transaction to stake Hoodi ETH
* How to sign and broadcast a staking transaction

### 1. Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    The Coinbase Typescript SDK requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18+. To verify your Node version:

    ```
    node -v
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Go">
    The Coinbase Go SDK requires Go 1.19 and recommends using 1.21+. To verify your Go version:

    ```
    go version
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. API Key Setup

To use the CDP SDK, you need a CDP secret API key. If you need to create one, follow [this guide](/get-started/authentication/cdp-api-keys#creating-api-keys).

Once you have the key, you can either save it as a file on your filesystem (if you downloaded it) or use the key details as environment variables. You will need to reference this later in your code.

<Info>
  **Optional API Key File Download**

  For enhanced security, API key files are no longer automatically downloaded. If you need to reference your API key via file path in your code, click the **Download API key** button in the modal to save the key file. Otherwise, you can copy the key details directly from the modal and use them as environment variables (recommended for better security).
</Info>

### 3. Create a Workspace

In your preferred shell, create a new directory:

```shell lines wrap theme={null}
mkdir staking-demo
cd staking-demo
```

### 4. Install the CDP SDK

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Install the CDP SDK using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash theme={null}
    npm install @coinbase/coinbase-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Go">
    Install the Coinbase SDK:

    ```shell theme={null}
    go get github.com/coinbase/coinbase-sdk-go
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 5. Create a Staking Transaction

To proceed with the stake example below, you need some Hoodi ETH in your wallet. If you don't have any, you can request some from the [Ethereum Hoodi Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/hoodi).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Create a new file named `stake.ts` and paste the code block below:

    ```typescript stake.ts [expandable] theme={null}
    import {
        Coinbase,
        ExternalAddress,
        StakeOptionsMode,
    } from "@coinbase/coinbase-sdk";

    // highlight-start
    const apiKeyFilePath = "YOUR_API_KEY_FILE_PATH";
    const walletAddress = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS";
    // highlight-end

    /**
     * Stake 0.005 ETH on the ethereum-hoodi testnet network.
     */
    async function stake() {
    Coinbase.configureFromJson({ filePath: apiKeyFilePath });

    // Create a new external address on the ethereum-hoodi testnet network.
    const address = new ExternalAddress(
        Coinbase.networks.EthereumHoodi,
        walletAddress,
    );

    // Find out how much ETH is available to stake.
    const stakeableBalance = await address.stakeableBalance(
        Coinbase.assets.Eth,
        StakeOptionsMode.PARTIAL,
    );

    console.log("Stakeable balance of address %s is %s ETH", walletAddress, stakeableBalance);

    // Build a stake transaction for an amount <= stakeableBalance
    process.stdout.write("Building a transaction to stake 0.005 ETH...");
    const stakingOperation = await address.buildStakeOperation(
        0.005,
        Coinbase.assets.Eth,
        StakeOptionsMode.PARTIAL,
    );

    console.log("Staking Operation ID: %s", stakingOperation.getID())

    console.log("Done.");
    }

    (async () => {
    try {
        await stake();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error during stake operation", error);
    }
    })();
    ```

    #### Note

    * Be sure to replace the placeholder values with your own for:

    ```text theme={null}
    YOUR_API_KEY_FILE_PATH
    YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
    ```

    Then run the code to create a staking transaction:

    ```
    npx ts-node stake.ts
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Go">
    Create a new file named stake.go

    ```go showLineNumbers stake.go [expandable] theme={null}

    func main() {

    Run the code:

The transaction that was generated is an unsigned transaction. This still needs to be signed and broadcasted to the network to stake successfully. See the next section for instructions on how to sign and broadcast the transaction.

### 6. Sign and Broadcast your Staking Transaction

The previous step generated an unsigned transaction. To stake successfully, the transaction needs to be signed and broadcasted to the network.

Signing and broadcasting functionality is added to the example from above. The additional lines are highlighted for clarity.
