The EVM Smart Account APIs enable you to create and manage Smart Account wallets across EVM-compatible blockchains.

A **Smart Account** is an EVM account that enables enhanced functionality such as account abstraction, batched transactions, and gas sponsorship through [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). Smart Accounts allow users to create and manage "user operations" instead of traditional EVM transactions.
Smart Accounts are identified by their **address**, which is a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string.
Smart Accounts can be assigned an optional **name** at creation time for easier identification in subsequent API calls.

A Smart Account has a single owner, which is another EVM Account which signs the Smart Account's transactions. The owner can be a CDP EVM account, or an account managed solely by the developer.
