# EVM Token Balances
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/v2/rest-api/evm-token-balances/evm-token-balances



The EVM Token Balances APIs enable you to retrieve the balances of EVM addresses.
This includes tokens (i.e. ERC-20s) and the native gas token of the network.

## Denomination

* 'amount' is denominated in the smallest indivisible unit of the token. For ETH, the smallest indivisible unit is Wei (10^-18 ETH). For ERC-20s, the smallest unit is the unit returned from `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`.
* 'decimals' is the exponential value N that satisfies the equation `amount * 10^-N = standard_denomination`. The standard denomination is the most commonly used denomination for the token.

  * In the case of the native gas token, `decimals` is defined via convention. As an example, for ETH of Ethereum mainnet, the standard denomination is 10^-18 the smallest denomination (Wei). As such, for ETH on Ethereum mainnet, `decimals` is 18.
  * In the case of ERC-20 tokens, `decimals` is defined via configuration. `decimals` will be the number returned by `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)` on the underlying token contract.
