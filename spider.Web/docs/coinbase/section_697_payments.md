### Payment Rails

Payment rails are the source or the target of a transfer.
We support the following payment rails:

* Crypto rails: Onchain currency and networks to send and receive crypto (e.g. Currency: USDC, Network: Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Polygon, Avalanche).
* Payment methods: Payment methods that are previously added in your account (e.g Debit Card).

### Transfer

A Transfer is a money movement between two payment rails. we support the following transfer types:

* Fiat to Crypto transfer

  * Source: a payment method (payment method that is already added in your account. e.g. Card)

  * Target: onchain address to receive crypto

### Create a Transfer

1. Use `/v2/payments/rails/payment-methods` and `/v2/payments/rails/crypto` to get all available payment rails.

2. Choose the payment rails to use as source and target, and the amount to transfer.
   * Use `/v2/payments/transfers` to create a transfer quote.
   * Optionally, you can set `execute` to true to execute the transfer quote immediately.

3. Once you have a transfer quote, use `/v2/payments/transfers/{transferId}/execute` to execute a transfer quote.

4. Use `/v2/payments/transfers/{transferId}` to get a transfer by transferId.
