# Policy Engine
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/v2/rest-api/policy-engine/policy-engine



The Policy Engine APIs evaluate policies (a set of rules) to govern the behavior of accounts or projects, such as enforce allowlists and denylists.

* A **policy** is a collection of `rules` with defined criteria.
* Each **rule** contains a specified `action`, `operation`, and `criteria`:
  * An `action` can either `accept` or `reject` a transaction if the criteria in the rule are met.
  * `criteria` is an array of logical expressions. All parameters must evaluate to true for the action to be applied.
  * An `operation` corresponds to a CDP v2 API:
    * `signEvmTransaction` or `signSolTransaction` for signing transactions (to set a transaction limit).
    * `sendEvmTransaction` for signing a transaction, and sending it to a supported network.
    * `signEvmHash` for signing an arbitrary 32 byte hash.
    * `signEvmMessage` for signing an [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) message.
    * `prepareUserOperation` for preparing user operations on a smart account.
    * `sendUserOperation` for sending user operations using a smart account.
    * `signEndUserEvmTransaction` or `signEndUserSolTransaction` for signing end user transactions (to set a transaction limit).
    * `sendEndUserEvmTransaction` for signing an end user transaction, and sending it to a supported EVM network.
    * `sendEndUserSolTransaction` for signing an end user transaction, and sending it to a supported Solana network.
    * `signEndUserEvmMessage` for signing an end user [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) message.
    * `signEndUserEvmTypedData` for signing end user [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) typed data.
    * `signEndUserSolMessage` for signing an end user Solana message.
* A **rule** indicates how an operation should behave, specifying whether a request with defined criteria should be accepted or rejected.

## Policy Scope

Policies can be applied at the project and/or account level:

* **Project-level policy**: A `project`-level policy applies to all accounts in a CDP Project. Only one project-level policy can be applied to accounts within a CDP Project at any given time.
* **Account-level policy**: An `account`-level policy applies to one or more accounts. An account
  can have at most one account-level policy at any given time.

Thus, a single account can be assigned at most two policies at any given time: one project-level policy and one account-level policy.

**Note:** End user operation rules (e.g., `signEndUserEvmTransaction`, `sendEndUserSolTransaction`) currently only apply for policies with the `project` scope.

Scope is specified in the `scope` field of a policy:

```json { theme={null}
  "description": "Project-level policy",
  "scope": "account",
  ...
```

## Policy Evaluation

**Project-level policies** are evaluated first, followed by **account-level policies**.
The Policy Engine will process the request against each rule in the order it is defined within the `rules` array:

1. If the rule's `criteria` (processed as a logical **AND** operation applied to a list of independently evaluated boolean expressions) are met, `accept` or `reject` behavior is applied immediately and the engine stops further evaluation of the policy.
2. If after policy evaluation, no rule's `criteria` are met, the engine moves to processing the next policy (i.e., an `account`-level policy).
3. If no further policies exist, the request is rejected.

For example, the following policy is a project-level policy with two rules. The Policy Engine will:

1. **Evaluate the first rule:** For a `signEvmTransaction` request, accept the request if the transaction is less than or equal to 1000000000000000000 wei OR
2. **Evaluate the second rule:** if the request is a `signEvmTransaction` request, accept the request if the transaction is less than or equal to 2000000000000000000 wei AND the request is made to the address `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`.
3. **If the request does not meet the criteria of either rule**, the engine will move on to evaluate an `account`-level policy (if one exists).
4. Otherwise, the request is rejected.

Rules are processed in the order they are defined. Once a rule applies to an operation, subsequent rules are ignored.

```json theme={null}
{
  "description": "Project-level policy",
  "scope": "project",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "operation": "signEvmTransaction",
      "criteria": [
        {
          "type": "ethValue",
          "ethValue": "1000000000000000000",
          "operator": "<="
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "operation": "signEvmTransaction",
      "criteria": [
        {
          "type": "ethValue",
          "ethValue": "2000000000000000000",
          "operator": "<="
        },
        {
          "type": "evmAddress",
          "addresses": [
            "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE"
          ],
          "operator": "in"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Policy Application

Project-level policies are applied to all accounts in a CDP Project. They will apply retroactively even if the project-level policy is created after the account was created. To disable a project-level policy, you must remove the project-level policy from the CDP Project using the `deletePolicy` operation.

Account-level policies can be applied in two ways:

* By specifying the `accountPolicy` field in the request body of the `createEvmAccount` and
  `createSolAccount` operations.

* By specifying the `accountPolicy` field in the request body of the `updateEvmAccount` and
  `updateSolanaAccount` operations.

## Restricting Contract Interactions on Ethereum

Smart contract function restrictions serve as a critical security and governance mechanism in decentralized applications, allowing developers and organizations to implement fine-grained access controls over their protocol interactions.
One of the primary use cases for function restrictions is protecting high-risk operations from unauthorized access such as:

* Fund transfers - Contract upgrades - Parameter modifications - Emergency pauses
  Policy Engine supports such restrictions that evaluate against transaction data with the `evmData` criterion for the `signEvmTransaction`, and `sendEvmTransaction` operations.

## Examples

### USD Limits

The following example demonstrates a policy that only allows transactions to transfer, or expose the sender to, less than \$100.00 worth of assets at a time. This USD denominated amount includes native assets, `ERC20`, `ERC721`, and `ERC1155` tokens calculated using current market prices.

} ```
### Limiting USDC Spend
This policy restricts USDC transactions on the Base network to transfers of 10,000 tokens or less. It applies to both signing and sending transactions to the USDC contract address, using the ERC20 ABI to validate that only `transfer` function calls with a `value` parameter under the specified limit are permitted.
