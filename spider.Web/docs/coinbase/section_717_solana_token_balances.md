# Solana Token Balances
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/v2/rest-api/solana-token-balances/solana-token-balances



The Solana Token Balances APIs enable you to retrieve the balances of Solana addresses.
This includes SPL tokens and the native SOL token of the network.

## Denomination

* 'amount' is denominated in the smallest indivisible unit of the token. For SOL, the smallest indivisible unit is lamports (10^-9 SOL). For SPL tokens, the smallest unit is defined by the token's decimals configuration.
* 'decimals' is the exponential value N that satisfies the equation `amount * 10^-N = standard_denomination`. The standard denomination is the most commonly used denomination for the token.

  * For native SOL, `decimals` is 9 (1 SOL = 10^9 lamports).
  * For SPL tokens, `decimals` is defined in the token's mint configuration.
