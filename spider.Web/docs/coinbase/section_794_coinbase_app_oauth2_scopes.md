# Coinbase App OAuth2 Scopes
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/coinbase-app/oauth2-integration/scopes



Scopes allow you to specify fine-grained access for your OAuth2 applications. Getting your scopes right is key to developing safe and trustworthy applications.

## Overview

With OAuth2, scopes are set in the [authorization URL](/coinbase-app/oauth2-integration/integrations) and determine what API endpoints your application can access. All authenticated endpoints, except `GET /user`, require a specific scope.

With OAuth2, scopes should be considered as **grants**—users can select which scopes they allow for your application. To see which scopes a user has granted, use the `GET /user/auth` endpoint.

<Warning>
  **Plan your scopes carefully before launch.** Scopes are declared when you register your OAuth application and are difficult to change later. Adding new scopes after users have already authorized your app requires them to re-authorize, which can disrupt their user experience.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Only request scopes your application needs. Users more readily grant access to limited, clearly described scopes.
</Tip>

### Naming pattern

Scopes follow the pattern `service:resource:action`. The main services are `wallet` and `data`.

| Action   | Description                                                   |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `read`   | List or read resources (e.g., listing transactions)           |
| `create` | Create new resources (some have specific actions like `send`) |
| `update` | Update existing resources                                     |
| `delete` | Delete resources                                              |

## Account access

In addition to scopes, Coinbase App applications can request different levels of access to user's wallets. This access is defined by a dropdown selection on the consent page when the user connects to your app.

Account access works **together with scopes**. For example, `account=all` combined with `scope=wallet:buys:create` allows your app to create buys on all of the user's wallets, but won't give access to sell on any of their accounts.

## Specifying scopes

Scopes are specified by including a `scope` parameter in your OAuth2 authorization request. Multiple scopes should be separated with a comma:

```
https://login.coinbase.com/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL&scope=wallet:accounts:read,wallet:transactions:read
```

If you need to obtain more permissions later, you can re-authenticate the user, prompting them to authorize additional scopes.

## Supported scopes

Below are listed all the available scopes for both Coinbase App application and API keys. For more information to understand which permission is required for a specific API action/endpoint, follow our `API reference` which includes *Permissions* section under each endpoint.
