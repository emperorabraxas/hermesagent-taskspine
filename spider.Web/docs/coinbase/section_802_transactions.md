### Transaction Statuses

Transaction statuses vary based on the type of the transaction. As both types and statuses can change over time, we recommend that you use `details` field for constructing human readable descriptions of transactions. Currently available statuses are:

| `expired`               | Conditional transaction expired due to external factors |
| `failed`                | Failed transactions (e.g., failed buy)                  |
| `pending`               | Pending transactions (e.g., a send or a buy)            |

## Send Money

Send funds to a network address for any [Coinbase supported asset](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/supported-crypto), or email address of the recipient. No transaction fees are required for off-blockchain cryptocurrency transactions.

<Check>
  Phone number sends via the Send Money API is temporarily disabled.
  Sends to phone numbers via the Send Money API is under reconstruction, and is temporarily disabled until further notice.
  Sends to blockchain addresses and email addresses remain unchanged.
</Check>

The Send money API is asynchronous, which means that Coinbase may delay or cancel the send when necessary. Coinbase recommends that you poll the `status` field for the `completed` state with the [Show a Transaction](#show-a-transaction) API. You can also see if a transaction is `pending` in the Send Money API response.

When used with OAuth2 authentication, this endpoint requires [two factor authentication](/coinbase-app/oauth2-integration/2fa).
