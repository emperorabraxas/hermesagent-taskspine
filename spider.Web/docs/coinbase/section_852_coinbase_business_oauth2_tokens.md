# Coinbase Business OAuth2 Tokens
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/coinbase-business/authentication-authorization/oauth2/access-and-refresh-tokens



Coinbase uses an optional security feature of OAuth2 called refresh tokens, if the scope `offline_access` was requested in the authorize (`oauth2/auth`) request.

When you first authenticate, your app is given an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`. The access token authenticates all your requests; but **the access token expires in one hour**. Once expired, you must use the refresh token to obtain a new access token and a new refresh token.

**The refresh token expires after 1.5 years**; and it can only be exchanged once for a new set of access and refresh tokens. If you try to make a call with an expired access or refresh token, a `401` response is returned.

<Warning>
  Tokens

  Use the refresh token to request a new access token *and* a new refresh token:

  * Access tokens expire in one hour.
  * Refresh tokens expire after 1.5 years and can only be exchanged once.
</Warning>

This process adds some complexity for Coinbase Business integrations, but provides an valuable layer of security since a compromised access token is automatically revoked after one hour.

## Refreshing Access & Refresh Tokens

To get a new access token, you must send a POST request to `/oauth2/token` with your `refresh_token` and change the `grant_type` to `refresh_token`.

<Warning>
  There were changes to OAuth2 on [March 27, 2024](/coinbase-app/introduction/changelog#2024-mar-27).
</Warning>

The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are not required for this request.

```shell lines wrap theme={null}
curl https://login.coinbase.com/oauth2/token \
  -X POST \
  -d 'grant_type=refresh_token&
      client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
      client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&
      refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN'
```

The expected result is a response containing the access token, as before:

```json lines wrap theme={null}
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "scope": "all"
}
```

<Tip>
  If you are using an OAuth2 library that supports refresh tokens, the library automatically takes care of these details.

## Revoking an Access Token

Access tokens can be revoked manually if you want to disconnect your application's access to the user's account. Revoking can also be used to implement a log-out feature. You must supply the current access token twice, once to revoke it, and another to authenticate the request (either containing `access_token` parameter or `Authentication` header with bearer token). `200 OK` is returned for both successful and unsuccessful requests.

```shell lines wrap theme={null}
curl https://login.coinbase.com/oauth2/revoke \
  -X POST \
  -d 'token=ACCESS_TOKEN&
      client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
      client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 6915ab99857fec1e6f2f6c078583756d0c09d7207750baea28dfbc3d4b0f2cb80'
```
