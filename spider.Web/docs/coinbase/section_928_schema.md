| log\_index        | uint32                             | The index of the log within the transaction. First log is in the transaction at index 0, second is index 1, etc                                                                                                     |

| action            | Enum8('removed' = -1, 'added' = 1) | If the log is created, it is 1. If the log is re-orged out it is -1. If the sum of all actions for a given log is greater than 0, the log is "active", meaning it is still in the chain (has not been re-orged out) |

## base.transfers

Token transfer events including block details, addresses, and amounts

<Tip>
  See example token transfers on [Basescan](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913) (USDC on Base) to understand how transfer events appear on the blockchain.
