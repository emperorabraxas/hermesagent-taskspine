# Welcome to Token Balances API
Source: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/data/token-balance/welcome



## Overview

The Token Balances API enables you to retrieve public token balances of addresses on Base. This includes tokens (i.e. [ERC-20s](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)) and the native gas tokens.

You can retrieve public token balances using the [REST API](/api-reference/v2/rest-api/evm-token-balances/list-evm-token-balances) or [CDP SDK](/data/token-balance/cdp-sdk).

<Tip>
  **Need balances for wallets you own?** Use the [Wallet API](/server-wallets/v2/using-the-wallet-api/token-balances).

## Core capabilities

* **Lightning-fast performance**: Sub-1s query latency (P99) with real-time data updates within 1 second from tip of chain
* **Standardized responses**: Unified data format with 99.9%+ uptime
* **Universal address queries**: Access public balance data for addresses without ownership requirements
* **Comprehensive token coverage**: Returns both native ETH and ERC-20 token balances

## Base support and performance

The Token Balances API supports both Base Mainnet and Base Sepolia testnet with sub-1 second P99 latency. Base Mainnet tracks all tokens, while Base Sepolia tracks the top 100 most active token addresses for that network.

The API uses a two-step process: first checking a database to find which tokens an address owns, then reading the exact balance from the token's smart contract to ensure fast responses with accurate amounts.

## Use cases

* **Portfolio Tracker dApp**: Build a real-time portfolio tracker that monitors Base Mainnet whale wallets. Track how top addresses like [exchange wallets](https://basescan.org/address/0x835678a611b28684005a5e2233695fb6cbbb0007) allocate their holdings across different tokens.

* **DeFi Analytics Dashboard**: Create analytics tools that analyze token distribution patterns. Monitor how DeFi protocols' treasury addresses evolve over time or track liquidity provider positions across multiple DEXs.

* **Trading Infrastructure**: Develop arbitrage bots that monitor specific addresses for balance changes. Enable pre-trade balance verification, market maker inventory tracking, and quick reaction to large holder movements.

* **Compliance & Risk Management**: Build KYC/AML solutions that monitor address activity. Track token flows between addresses, generate audit trails, and flag suspicious patterns in real-time.
