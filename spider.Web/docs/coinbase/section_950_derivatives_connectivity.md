## Connectivity via Cross Connect

Coinbase Derivatives Exchange (CDE) participants can [establish cross-connects](#how-to-connect) in the facilities detailed under [CDE Locations](#data-center-locations).

<Frame>
  <img alt="Multicast connection using the BGP routing protocol with PIM" />
</Frame>

#### How to Connect

1. **Contact the CDE team** about establishing a private co-located fiber connection. <br />

   *The CDE team will:*

   a. Issue a letter of authorization (LOA) allowing you, the participant, to connect into CDE equipment.

   <Info>
     Redundant Connections
     Each fiber connects to physical equipment that is completely redundant from the other connections.
   </Info>

   b. Assign 2 IP address per side:

   * 1 address range for BGP peering.
   * 1 address range for connecting to CDE that is advertised by the participant.

   c. Assign a private ASN for BGP peering. Participants can use a public ASN as long as it is owned by them.

2. **Configure BGP** with all parameters provided by CDE.

3. **Optionally, configure PIM and RP addresses** to receive multicast market data. [RP Addresses](#cross-connect-multicast-rps) for each connection are provided by CDE.

## Connectivity via Internet

Clients may connect to select Coinbase Derivatives APIs via the internet. This solution is recommended for testing or non-latency sensitive systems. Please note that Coinbase Derivatives only accepts SSL/TLS1 encrypted connections for internet-based connections. See IP Addressing section for target host names.

Clients are encouraged to whitelist both Production and DR public addresses on their firewalls.

### SSL/TLS Details

* Preferred: TLSv1.2 128 bits ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 Curve P-256 DHE 256
* Accepted: TLSv1.2 128 bits ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 Curve P-256 DHE 256
* Accepted: TLSv1.2 256 bits ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 Curve P-256 DHE 256

* Accepted: TLSv1.2 256 bits AES256-SHA256

## Connectivity via AWS PrivateLink

Clients may connect to Coinbase Derivatives Exchange via AWS PrivateLink. This allows for some of the benefits of private connectivity without having to cross connect directly in the datacenter. Private connectivity via AWS PrivateLink offers reduced latency and a more stable connection when compared to the Public Internet. It should be noted that for the lowest latency and most stable connection possible, Colocation Cross Connects are still recommended.

Each PrivateLink has multiple availability zones and regions that are supported. However, for the most optimal results using the primary region and availability zone is recommended.

<Info>
  To configure PrivateLink, send your AWS Account ID to `derivatives@coinbase.com` so that it may be authorized.
  Once authorized, you’ll see the service name in your console.
</Info>

* **FIX Marketdata**

1. **Navigate to VPC > Endpoints**

2. **Click 'Create Endpoint'**

3. **Select 'Endpoint Services that use NLBs and GWLBs' under Type**
   * Enter the PrivateLink service name provided by Coinbase Derivatives (see above for service names) into Service Name field.
   * If using cross region connectivity check 'Enable Cross Region Endpoint' and select the region of the endpoint.

4. **Choose your VPC, subnets, and security groups**
   * Select the VPC you want to use, then choose the appropriate subnets and security groups for your environment.

5. **Enable Private DNS (optional)**

* If you want to use private DNS records added to your VPC, check the 'Enable DNS name' (see above for service support).

6. **Review and create the endpoint**
   * Review your selections and click "Create endpoint" to finish.

<Info>
  After provisioning, test connectivity to the endpoint and ensure your security group rules allow traffic to the required ports and protocols.

### Targeting Specific Feeds Over Internet and AWS PrivateLink

When connecting over the internet or AWS PrivateLink, participants can target a specific feed (A or B) by adjusting the port number:

* **Aggregate:** The port listed in the tables refers to the aggregate port, which will load balance traffic across all available feeds.
* **A Feed:** Use the aggregate(base) port **+1**
* **B Feed:** Use the aggregate(base) port **+2**

For example, if the aggregate port is `6110`:

* Use `6111` to target the A Feed directly.
* Use `6112` to target the B Feed directly.

This allows participants to explicitly select which feed to connect to when required.

<Info>
  The following services are not currently supported for this functionality.\
  **Integration:** SBE Order\
  **Disaster Recovery:** FIX Drop Copy
